# Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate

This repo is my personal log of working through the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** on Coursera.  

I’ll be using it to keep track of what I’ve learned in each course, along with my own notes, reflections, and any resources or labs I want to save. The idea is to have everything in one place that I can look back on later.

## How this repo is organised

- Each course has its own folder.  
- Inside each folder I’ll keep a short course summary, and then separate markdown files for each module.  
- Module files are just my notes — not polished guides, just what helped me learn.
