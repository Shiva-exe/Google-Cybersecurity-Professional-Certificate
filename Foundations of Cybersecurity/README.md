# Course 1: Foundations of Cybersecurity

This folder is for my notes from **Course 1: Foundations of Cybersecurity**. The course is a broad introduction to the field and gives a good idea of what cybersecurity analysts actually do.

## What I Learned

(In-depth of each module i'll try and do after i finish the course as I am on a crunch to get it done in 7 days ðŸ˜¤)

**Main takeaways:**
- Cybersecurity is about protecting people, systems, and data â€” not just technology.  
- Entry-level analysts need both technical knowledge (tools, frameworks, scripting) and soft skills (communication, problem solving).  
- Past cyberattacks have shaped how we approach security today.  
- Frameworks like the **CIA triad** and **NIST CSF** give a structured way to think about security and risk.  
- Tools like **SIEMs** and **packet analyzers** are part of an analystâ€™s daily toolkit.  
- Python and SQL are worth learning because they help automate and analyse security tasks.
