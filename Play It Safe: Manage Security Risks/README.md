# Course 2: Play It Safe – Manage Security Risks

This folder contains my notes and impressions from **Course 2: Play It Safe – Manage Security Risks**, part of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. This course took things up a notch—moving from foundational ideas to real-world risk management, tools, and incident response.

## What Stood Out to Me

- Being able to run my own mock security audit was kind of entertaining. I used a checklist to assess a fictional company’s controls and compliance. It felt like a real analyst task—not just theory, but practical application.

## Why This Course Was Valuable

This course was where theory started to feel functional. I got to apply what I learned by doing my own audit and walking through live-like incident response steps. It felt like actually being in a SOC (security operations center)—instead of just reading about concepts.
